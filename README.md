# Prelog

Prelog is a programming language that allows users to create their
own domain-specific languages in the form of *interpreters*.
The Prelog philosophy advocates the creation of mini languages for specific tasks
so that interpreters become the primary building blocks of larger programs.

Prelog is a logical language, but not in the tradition of Prolog.
A Prelog program is just a sequence of terms, where every new term is
evaluated in the current program, and the result is appended to it.
This simple method allows for a surprisingly rich model of programming.
